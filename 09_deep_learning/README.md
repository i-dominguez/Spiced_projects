## 09. Deep Learning - Artificial Neural Network

The goal of this project was to build an Artificial Neural Network that recognizes objects on images made by the webcam:

The project included the following tasks:

1. Implementing a Feed-Forward Neural Network
2. Backpropagation from Scratch
3. Building Neural Network with Keras
4. Training Strategies / Hyperparameters of Neural Networks
5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
6. Classifying images made with webcam with Pre-trained Networks (Comparing MobileNetV2, InceptionV3)
7. Image Detection
