Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool
I guess we're ready for the summer
Cool, cool, cool, cool

I like us better when we're intertwined
The way you touch me got me losing my senses (ah-ha)
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine
You got me workin' up an appetite, 'tite

And the color of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I can see us in the real life
You know, you know, you got

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We got the heat and the thrill
'Cause you're more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me
You got me losing all my cool

Skin-tight
I'll show you heaven there's nothing better
I'll give it to you all night
You know, you know, you know
Got me losing all my cool
And you like the way I move
In control of what I do
And my love makes you brand new

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We got the heat and the thrill
'Cause you're more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool (hey, you)
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool

I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool

I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool

I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool

I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool
