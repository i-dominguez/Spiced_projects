Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

Sleep, pretty darlin', do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep, pretty darlin', do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

Sleep, pretty darlin', do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
