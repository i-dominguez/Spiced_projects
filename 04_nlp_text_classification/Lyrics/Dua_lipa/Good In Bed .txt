Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I've been thinkin' it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinkin' it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands upon my-

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messin' with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please
Come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight and the long nights
Where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down I get so up
Don't know if I could find someone 
Who do me like you do

I've been thinkin' it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinkin' it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands upon my waist

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messin' with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please
Come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

Yeah, we don't know how to talk
(Mm)
But damn, we know how to f*ck

Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
As the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras, sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Gigolo
Huh, sucka?
Gigolo, gigolo
Huh, sucka?
(Gigolo)

(I love you, I love you)
But damn, we know how to fu-
(I love you)
