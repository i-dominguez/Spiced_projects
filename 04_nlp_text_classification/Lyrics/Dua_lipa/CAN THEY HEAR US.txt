Every breath that I'm takin', every step that I'm makin'
Ain't no way I can run without you
Every ghost in my past life held my hand when I crashed down
Carries me when I wanna break through

We all die, but right now I feel like livin'
And we all cry, but right now I'm not gonna give in
When we collide I know I can do anything
'Cause I got ya, and you got me

(Ooh) Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin'
Can they hear us? Can they hear us? (Ooh)

Anywhere that I turn to got me goin' in circles
No matter what, I'll make sure we get out

'Cause we all die, but right now I feel like livin'
And we all cry, but right now I'm not gonna give in
When we collide I know I can do anything
'Cause I got ya, and you got me

(Ooh) Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin'
Can they hear us? Can they hear us?

(Ooh) Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious
We all die, but right now I feel like livin' (I feel like livin')
Can they hear us? Can they hear us?
Can they hear us?
Blame it on my mind, blame it on delirious (blame it on delirious)
We all die, but right now I feel like livin' (I feel like livin')
Can they hear us? Can they hear us?
