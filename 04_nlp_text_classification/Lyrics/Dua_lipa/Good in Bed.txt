(Hey)
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I've been thinkin' it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinkin' it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands upon my waist

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messin' with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please
Come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
And the long nights
Where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down I get so up
Don't know if I could find someone who do me like you do

I've been thinkin' it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinkin' it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands upon my waist

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messin' with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please
Come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

(Ah)
Yeah, we don't know how to talk
(Mm)
But damn, we know how to f*ck

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messin' with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please
Come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
