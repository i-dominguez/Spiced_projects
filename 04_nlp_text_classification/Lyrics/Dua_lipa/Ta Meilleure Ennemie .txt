Look what you started
Feeling discarded
Too open-hearted
Feelings disregarded

And I am caught up in you, caught in me  
As we slide all the way down
And I've been caught up in you, caught in me
As we're pearls to the ground
So take a breath and look at me now

I-I-I'll let you know
When the Pearls on my neck get too tight, I'll let go
At least I could leave you
I wouldn't, I need you
And if I could shake you
I wouldn't, I'd take you down

Say you don't like it
When I ignite it
You try to fight it
But I know you get excited

When you take hold of my hips
I insist, please slide it all the way down
And I've been bitin' my lips
I insist, we smother onto the ground
So take a breath and look at me now
So take a breath and look at me now

I-I-I'll let you know
When the Pearls on my neck get too tight, I'll let go
At least I could leave you
I wouldn't, I need you
And if I could shake you
I wouldn't, I'd take you down

I-I-I'll let you know
When the Pearls on my neck get too tight, I'll let go
At least I could leave you
I wouldn't, I need you
And if I could shake you
I wouldn't, I'd take you down
Down
Down
