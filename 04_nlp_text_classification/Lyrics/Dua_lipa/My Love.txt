You've been here, but you've been missin' for some time now
Yeah, yeah
Every time I see you, it's a different vibe now
Yeah, oh
I can't help but let you just go away
Oh, oh
Can we get back what we had yesterday?
Oh, oh

Can I ride with you?
Better know that I'mma ride for you
Bet I'd use a gun and knife for you
I ain't finna choose the side over you
Am I right with you?
Ain't nothin' I won't provide for you
Ain't nobody in my life like you
'Cause ain't nobody gonna shine like you

Show me my love, oh God

My mink draggin' like it's Liu Kang
My show packed, all the dimes there
But I be falling back from all the loose change
I drop the top on that new thing
My chocolate broad, they rock Gucci
Gotta know it's impossible to stop Folarin
Got the box, I want the new thing, yeah
She gon' show out, show out
Before its wahala, "Roll out, roll out"
She gon' show out, show out
Before you break it down, girl, roll out, roll out

Better know that we can live for each other
That don't mean I gotta die for you

Hard to hear, too many girls in the house, ayy
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out
I started here, I got the buzz and the clout
I know, I know she got it all, but got nothin' to hold
Every time I saw her, not too many, no
She ain't really hard, she act because she heard, duh
And I can be your last
Leave the past with your first

Show me my love, oh God
