Somewhere in the middle
I think I lied a little
I, I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kind of tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
I hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
But my mind is running wild, could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So baby, come try me, baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kind of tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
I hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
But my mind is running wild, could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease

Trickle down my spine
Boy, you look so pretty please
Every single night
I need your hands on me
When your kiss is kind
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Make me feel so pretty
Would you help me out please?
