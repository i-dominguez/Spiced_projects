I see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin

I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
They say love is religion

There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favorite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms 'cause

I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes

They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)

This is Yaeji, and you're listening to Club Future Nostalgia
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
If you don't wanna see me
