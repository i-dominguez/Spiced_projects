Um, this is My My My!

Ahh, ahh

Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

So, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me, mmm

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my

Gonna be the last night ever
Gonna be the last night we're apart
Got my heart on this treasure
On this treasure

Oh my, my, my
I die every night
(I die, I die, I die, I die, every night)
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
(Living for, living for, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
(Oh my, oh my, oh my oh)
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my

Yes!
