All the girls, stomp your feet like this
All the girls, stomp your feet like this
All the girls, stomp your feet like this
All the girls, stomp your feet like this

Few times, I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no Hollaback Girl
I ain't no Hollaback Girl
Few times, I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no Hollaback Girl
I ain't no Hollaback Girl

Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate
I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate
I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate

Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate
I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate
I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate

Oh, how you shine
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate
