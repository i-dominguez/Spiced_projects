I bet we're higher than the people on cloud nine
This connection got me feeling like
I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So why do I think of losing you
When you're right by my side, uh

I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up

So baby, don't you let go (uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever (uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks on my imagination
Ruining my night, wow
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna
Tell me it's goodbye, uh

I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up

So baby, don't you let go (uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever (uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

So baby, don't you let go
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here?
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?

So baby, don't you let go (uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever (uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
