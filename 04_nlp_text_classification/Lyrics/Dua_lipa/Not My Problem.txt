We doing good
We doing good
That's your problem

Pulling me down like an anchor
Saying it's my fault you're angered
Telling me no one will love me (watch your mouth)
Telling me I'm gon' be lonely
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)
You had me on for a good run
Thinking that you were a good one
Under your palm, yeah, you like that (what the f*ck?)
Now it's my turn to bite back (I've had enough)

Ooh, did it to yourself
Playing with my mind
Putting me through hell
Ooh, I'd be broken too
If you left me like
Like I left you
(That's your problem)

Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (that's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (that's your problem)

Doing it all for reaction
Doing the most in your caption
Making me seem like the bad guy (watch your mouth)
Tryin' to bring me down, but nice try
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)

I used to like you
How did I like you? (What the f*ck?)
I used to like you
And now I don't (we doing good)

Ooh, I'd be broken too
If you left me like
Like I left you
(That's your problem)

Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (that's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (that's your problem)

I thought I liked you, I thought you was cool
But I'm a thot when I be drinking, don't be thinking shit through
Nevertheless, you got the clue
And now you blue 'cause I ain't speaking to you
Aww, boo boo, you'll be cool, don't boo-hoo
Boo, what's the issue?
JID j-just listen, this bi-, this chick trippin'
I'm dipping, I'm dipping, I'm done with it
I'm stupid, I'm dumb, come with it
I've heard them all
I'ma call you one name (that's your problem)

Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (that's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (that's your problem)
