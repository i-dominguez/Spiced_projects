I'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah

I won’t stop, not now
Guess what?
Hella, hella, it’s my body right
I glow in light
Hella, hella, it’s my body
I’ll dance if I want to

Hella, hella, it’s my body
Hella, hella, it’s my body

Some people do
But some, they just like to talk (okay)
Some shoot the breeze
But some like to leave a mark (okay)
Some need the light
And some people like the dark (okay, yeah)

I won’t stop, not now
Guess what?
Hella, hella, it’s my body right
I glow in light
Hella, hella, it’s my body
I’ll dance if I want to

Hella, hella, it’s my body
Hella, hella, it’s my body

Gimme release
Keep the drugs, gimme relief
Keep the love, just gimme a piece of that
One piece of that
Give it to me
Don’t blush, just give it to me
No heart, no second degree tonight
Run free tonight
I’ll dance if I want to

My body, my body, my body (Hella, hella, it’s my body)
Hella, hella, it’s my body
My body, my body, my body 
Hella, hella, it’s my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Gonna dance if I want to, want to (Hella, hella, it's my body)
