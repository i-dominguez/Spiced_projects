I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's somethin' left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that Heaven's right here, baby
Touch me so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again, again

So many nights my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn (goddamn), you got me in love again

Show me that Heaven's right here, baby
Touch me so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn (goddamn), you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again

Dance a-, dan-dance anymore
Dance a-, dan-dance anymore
Dance a-, dan-dance anymore
Dance, dan-dance anymore
