If we don't got the-, we gon' hop 'em
Bory hop out wit' them, tryna chop 'em (grrah-grrah, boom)

Talk on brodie, we spin for a week
Slide with Kay, only spend four V's (word to my mother)
Got a lil' thottie that holdin' my beam
F*ck that lil' boy who got left in a V (rah, rah)
Slide with two chop's, it's like thirty in each

And if he bunny hop, he get left in the scene (grrah-grrah)
Nesty a bitch, nigga begged on his knees (grrah)

Bitch, it's 300, DOA, blow for the guys

Bitch, I hang out the V with the pole, let it fly
They keep dissin' like I ain't get back, don't know why
Bitch, I'm GBG, word to your dead, word to mines
Talk on Nazzy and Berry, you must wanna die
Talk on Jayripk and 'jects but what happened to-?

None of these bitches is tough

All of my opps get mixed with the grabba
Broke bitch said she was gon' touch me (like, what?)
She lyin', hakuna matata
All the bros know that I'm uppin' that, boom for 'em (boom)
All the opps hope heaven, got room for 'em (grrah)
Everything dead, nothing is friendly
Up in my Prada, up in Balenci' (grrah-grrah, grrah)
