(Swiftondemand) You were the man yesterday
I'm the man right now
You had a plan yesterday
Got the plan right now
I was just playing yesterday
I ain't playing right now
Shit you was saying yesterday
You ain't saying right now
P-H!

You was the man yesterday

You're the man of the year
I'm the man of the decade
Chains so damn heavy
Can't even keep my neck straight
F*ck around and did the X-ray
Doc said I need a neck brace
Can't see me on your best day
Got 'em fronting like it's test day
Cookie Monster no Nabisco
Greasy nigga like Crisco
Rolly where the wrist go
Got me dancing like disco
Don't do lean, don't sip slow
Shorty, get down or get low
What these bitches want from a nigga?
No DMX, no Sisq√≥
Pussy sweeter than a raisin
Sex so amazing
I'm about to go balls deep
F*ck around and spend days in
She like go fast, go slow
I'm like bitch we ain't racing
Kick her out of the penthouse
Send her back to the basement

I might hit the bitch up right now
Told that stupid bitch to pipe down
Throwing shade and talking that shit
Please do all of that in my town
Yeah, that 4 train Bronx bound
Please do all of that when I'm around
Yeah, they heard I got a deal, thinking I'ma chill
Bitch, I still could get down
Man, they don't want me to body shit
But my swag and my lingo, they copied it
Man, they don't think I see you on some foggy shit
The Patek on my wrist is some rocking shit
Now I'm dripping so crazy, some fountain shit
Man, it's too much deposits, can't count the shit
I was missing some spot, so I'm polishing
I still go on the block, yeah, I'm proud of it
Look, I hit them with the peace sign
Leave them on decline
Catch me on the hive
On that five nine street time
See you with the clean lines
All they do is recline
My niggas wavy and got heart, give u C Lines
If you ain't catch that bitch, you better rewind
Run up on me, access denied
Won't hesitate to give a bitch bingo!
Ba-ba-ba, hit her three time!
