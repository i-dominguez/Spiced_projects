DJ Khaled

I get big paper, so I deal with big haters
Bi-big paper, so I deal with big haters
Bi-bi-big paper, so I deal with big haters
Go-go-got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors

It ain't a bitch like her, that's why these bitches don't like her (nope)
I respect shit-starters, not no shit-typers (uh)
Three year break, I still get this shit hyper (woo)
Shot back to the top, don't make a bitch snipe ya' (grr)
Big Bardi, they can't f*ck with me, hardly (woo)
Body anybody sayin' they don't know my body (uh)
I son bitches, move Kulture out the car seat
Got these hoes nervous, I can spit it to their heartbeat
Super valid anytime I link Khaled (woo)
Platinum plaques hang on every wall in my palace (ah)
Clips still push through anybody speakin' malice
Fashion icon, couple million for my stylist (ah)
Five number ones, you got five number nones (none)
Sleepin' on Cardi, all that nappin' shit done (done)
Off with your hat, all that cappin' shit done
And I got Hollywood waitin' when this rappin' shit done

I get big paper, so I deal with big haters (yeah)
Got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors (none)
Got it out the club, they ain't do me no favors (no)
Cardi this, Cardi that, make me more famous (woo)
Big paper, so I deal with big haters
Bi-big paper, so I deal with big haters
I get big paper, so I deal with big haters
Go-go-got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors

The most imitated, innovated, instigated
Playlist favorite, your shit, never played it (nah)
Had to make a way and your shit never made it
I was broke in the Bronx, but a bitch never hated (never)
Had to get my weight up, so I patiently waited
House with the palm trees for all the times I was shaded
Niggas out the woodworks, no, we never dated
Stop lyin' on the pussy when you know you never ate it (pussy)
Took the wig off and braided back my hair (woo)
Mixtape Cardi, like I ain't a millionaire (haha)
Big diamonds, single big diamonds in my ear
And my stock steady risin', you will never get a share (no)
Ridin' nigga faces, I don't never get a chair (ah)
If I don't take a break off, you would never get a year (never)
Prayin' on my downfall, you never get a prayer
Had to tighten up my circle, so it never fit a square

I get big paper, so I deal with big haters (yeah)
Got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors (none)
Got it out the club, they ain't do me no favors (no)
Cardi this, Cardi that, make me more famous (woo)
Big paper, so I deal with big haters
Bi-big paper, so I deal with big haters
I get big paper, so I deal with big haters
Go-go-got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors
