Oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Here I am, there you are, fallin' out of love again
I don't know just how to feel inside
I'll meet you where you are (are)
I needed some time apart ('part, ooh)
'Cause you been playin'
I've been loyal, no questions 
Boy, I've been ten toes down (ten toes down)
Cut communications with niggas that wanna be around (be around)
So I found it crazy how bitches is in my mentions now (now)
Nothin' that you're sayin' add up to me, how I'm feelin' now (feelin' 'now) (ooh)
I just wanna be everything you need
I wish you could see how you hurtin' me
I got no more love this time 
I'm done with that (done with that) (done with that)
I'm thinkin' of ways that I can hurt you back (hurt you back)

If I had you back (back)
I wouldn't've did all that (that)
I would've played it just how you wanted to play it
You didn't yet see my worth, so you tried to play me
But I was so in love, love
That I just got a little bit too complicated

But if I had you back, all I wanna do is f*ck (f*ck)
Get drunk (get drunk), take drugs (take drugs)
(F*ck love)
All I wanna do is f*ck (oh)
Get drunk (oh), hop planes
All lust (lust) 
It would be no lovin' you
It would be no lovin' you (yeah)

If I did it all again
I would give like ten percent
You deserve like half of that
I'ma need my money back
I'm ridin' through your hood, you pissed me off again
Finna let new niggas come find me
Out there trippin' like I don't got that designer pussy
All I'm tryna see is your credit card, swipe it all for me
Get me what I want, I don't need it
Just CC me, just VV me, just that dick when I call (dick when I call)
No more feelings involved, I done seen all I need to, oh
Funny how you say you 'bout us
You don't ever pull up on me, put it on me, get me right (yeah)
You the one that ruined us, can't give no, can't give no

F*ck (f*ck)
Get drunk (get drunk), take drugs (take drugs)
(F*ck love)
All I wanna do is f*ck (oh)
Get drunk (oh), hop planes
All lust (lust)
It would be no lovin' you
It would be no lovin' you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Come to find out you wasn't even worth my time
Tried to act like I wasn't good enough in your eyes
Funny now that you callin', that you ringin' my line
Why the hell is you ringin' my line?
Oh, I
Tell me what's changed, is it my status? Is it my fame?
Is it my pockets? Is it my change?
Is it my pride? Is it my body?
Back then, "no show, no call" was your motto
Only hit me up after the club and you off that bottle
Pussy so good you thought you hit the lotto

But if I had you back, all I wanna do is f*ck (f*ck)
Get drunk (get drunk), take drugs (take drugs)
(F*ck love)
All I wanna do is f*ck (oh)
Get drunk (oh), hop planes
All lust (lust)
It would be no lovin' you
It would be no lovin' you

Come to find out you wasn't even worth my time
Tried to act like I wasn't good enough in your eyes
Funny now that you callin', that you ringin' my line
Why the hell is you ringin' my line?
