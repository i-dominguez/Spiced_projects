You know
I could love you with all my heart
You're my baby and
And I love you, I just
I just feel the need to hurt you
Maybe I'm scorn
Or maybe I need a therapist
Maybe I'm petty
I just

I want to hurt you
I want to hurt you
I want to hurt you

I need to make you sure you remember me forever
Ever, ever, ever, ever
(I was raised well)
Ever, ever, ever, ever
I want to hurt you
I want to hurt you
I want to, I want to hurt you
I want to hurt, hurt, hurt
I want to hurt you
(Forever)
I want to hurt you
I want to, I want to hurt you
(Forever)
I want to hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
I want to hurt you

I want to hurt you
I got to make sure that you feel me
I need to make sure you remember me forever
I have to show you

Hi there
My name is, my name is
Cardi, Cardi, Cardi, Cardi B
I don't know
I love it
I love it
Loneliness
It fulfills my sorrow
You may think
You may think I have no tomorrow
It's easier to die, than to live
But I will show you
That I'm strong enough
To use you and abuse you
And I'm gonna live
And I'm gonna win (haha)
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win

I want to hurt you
I got to make sure that you feel me
I need to make sure they remember me forever
I have to show you
