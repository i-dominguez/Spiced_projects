Suck up on that clit until that pussy got a hickey, baby (Bounce)
Watch big, coulda bought a Range Rover (Range Rover)
Chain little, but I spent some change on it (Change on it)
Nigga mad, I'ma put the gang on him (Gang on it)
They'll die 'bout me, they'll bang on him (Facts)
And that ass poke out, lil' frame on her (Ow)
Pussy so good he got my name on him (Miami)
Itty bitty pretty, I'm the realest in the city
Only fuckin' with the plug, got a nigga worth a billi'
Showin' love, only talk about bands when he hit me
Chose him, he ain't pick me, and we never doin' quickies
