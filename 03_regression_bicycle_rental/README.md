## 03. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression - Bicycle Rental Forecast

The goal of this project is to build a regression model, in order to predict the total number of rented bycicles in each hour based on time and weather features, optimizing the accuracy of the model for RMSLE, using Kaggle's "Bike Sharing Demand" dataset that provides hourly rental data spanning two years.

After exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extracting datetime features, highly correlated variables were dropped via feature selection (correlation analysis) to avoid multicollinearity. I then used the Linear Regression model and obtained predictions with 0.7289 RMSLE.
