## 07. Time Series Analysis: Temperature Forecast

In this project, I applied the ARIMA model for a short-term temperature forecast. After visualizing the trend, the seasonality and the remainder of the time series data (daily mean temperature in Berlin-Tempelhof from 1979-2020), I run tests such as ADF for checking stationarity (time dependence).
